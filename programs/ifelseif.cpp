Hereâ€™s some sample output from the program in Listing 6.3:
    Enter a number in the range 1-100 to find my favorite number: 50
    Too high -- guess again: 25
    Too low -- guess again: 37
    Too high -- guess again: 31
    Too high -- guess again: 28
    Too high -- guess again: 27
    27 is right!
