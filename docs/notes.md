# Notes

The `good()` method in C++ is used to check the state of a stream object.
It returns true if none of the stream's error state flags (`eofbit`, `failbit`, `badbit`) are set. These flags indicate end-of-file, a logical error
on the stream, and a reading or writing error on the stream, respectively. If any of these flags are set, the good() method returns false.

It's a good practice to use `good()` or similar methods (`is_open()`, `fail()`, etc.) before writing data into a file.
These methods allow you to check the state of your file stream and ensure that it's safe to proceed with writing data.
If you don't check the state of the file stream before writing, you might encounter errors or exceptions, especially if the file doesn't exist, can't
be accessed, or has been corrupted.
